/**
 * A modelled estimate of how much attention a listing is getting.
 *
 * This exists as a sales argument: a clinic that has never heard of us needs a
 * reason to care that its profile is here, and "two hundred people looked at
 * this page and none of them could find a way to contact you" is that reason.
 *
 * Two things about it are deliberate and should not be quietly changed.
 *
 * It is **never rendered on a public page**. Presenting a modelled number to
 * patients as if it were measured traffic would be a straightforward
 * misrepresentation, and the whole value of the directory is that what it says
 * about a clinic is true. It appears in the clinic's own dashboard, labelled
 * as an estimate, and nowhere else.
 *
 * It is **deterministic**. Seeded from the provider id, so the same listing
 * shows the same number on every render, on every device, to every viewer.
 * A figure that drifts between reloads is not an estimate, it is a slot
 * machine, and the first clinic to notice would be right to stop trusting us.
 *
 * Replace this with `providers.clicks` the moment click tracking is persisted
 * — analytics.ts already has the TODO. Real numbers that start small beat
 * modelled numbers that start flattering.
