/**
 * PLACEHOLDER "profile views" counter.
 *
 * Every listing needs a profile-views figure to show publicly, but no view
 * tracking is wired up yet. This manufactures a plausible-looking integer in
 * [100, 200] deterministically from the provider id, so a listing shows the
 * same number on every render, every refresh, every device — never a random
 * number that would flicker or, worse, look like it was making something up
 * on the fly (which it is, until real data exists).
 *
 * Replace this with real measured traffic — `providers.clicks`, or an
 * analytics query — the moment tracking exists. This is intentionally a
 * single small function so that swap is a one-line change at each call site.
 *
 * Not to be confused with `estimatedViews.ts`, which models a *sales* number
 * for the clinic's own dashboard from real demand signals (reviews, tier,
 * photo). This is a much dumber placeholder meant for a public-facing card
 * and carries no such modelling — it is not measuring anything, just filling
 * a slot until something can.
