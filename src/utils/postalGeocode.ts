/**
 * Resolving a postal code to a point on the map.
 *
 * The directory used to answer this from its own rows: average the lat/lng of
 * every provider carrying a given code and call that the centre. That works
 * only for codes we already hold — 228 in Chihuahua and twenty-one in Texas —
 * so a patient in El Paso typing their own ZIP got an empty page with no
 * explanation, which is exactly the complaint that sent this here.
 *
 * Google's geocoder knows every code on both sides, and the Maps SDK is
 * already loaded for the map, so this costs no new key and no new dependency.
 * The derived centroid stays as an instant answer for codes we do hold.
 *
 * Which country matters. MX and US postal codes are both five digits and the
 * ranges do not overlap around the border, but they do overlap nationally —
 * 32300 is a Juárez colonia and also a Florida ZIP. So the caller says which
 * side it is looking from when it knows, and when it does not, both are tried
 * and an ambiguous code comes back as two candidates for the user to pick
 * between rather than as a guess.
