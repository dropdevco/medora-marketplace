/**
 * One hue per specialty, used wherever a specialty needs to be identifiable
 * at a glance rather than merely labelled — map pins, the category rail, the
 * monogram fallback on a card with no photo.
 *
 * Deliberately muted: these sit next to `--accent` on the same screen, and a
 * saturated palette would turn the map into confetti and start competing with
 * the promoted tier for attention. Each is a mid-tone that holds >= 3:1 on
 * both the light (#f0f0ee) and dark (#121316) map fills, so a pin reads in
 * either theme without a per-theme table.
 *
 * The two keys with no colour of their own — `general` and `telehealth` —
 * still get an entry rather than a fallback, because a `Record<Specialty, …>`
 * is what makes adding a specialty to the union a compile error here.
